I made this game as a personal project to experiment with 2D  graphics in Unity.
In this game, the player must continuously thrust a rocket ship upwards while dodging platforms and popping balloons.



### Key Objectives of Achieved in this Personal Project:

- Implement an infinite scroll system with a repeating background

- Implement an Object Pool for platforms that are randomly generated

- Create a custom 2D animation that is triggered by an event

- Create a custom 2D animation triggered by player input


### Stretch Goals Achieved
- Add custom audio for sound effects

- Restructure game in a way that will simplify porting to mobile platforms

- Implement an original idea
